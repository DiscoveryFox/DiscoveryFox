# 👋 Hey there, and welcome to my Github profile!

I'm a 15-year-old software engineer who is juggling school in K-Town and working at the awesome IT department at Fraunhofer. 💻🔧 My coding superpower lies in Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, and the language I created myself, Botscript, for creating Discord bots like a boss! 🤖 I can also speak Java, Kotlin, C, C++, and C# fluently, so you know I mean business. 💻

Let's talk about web development, I love making tools look pretty! 💅 I love using my CSS/HTML skills to add a touch of flair to tools like Hydra and Nmap, which usually only have a CLI interface. 🔨💻 And don't even get me started on my love for hacking! I'm a proud member of the Kali Linux community and always love to learn and improve my skills. 🕵️‍♂️

I'm a full-stack kind of guy, but if you need a hand with either front-end or back-end, I got you! I'm familiar with React, Tailwind, and Bootstrap frameworks and have experience with Flask, Django, and Selenium. 💻🚀

When I'm not coding, I love to spend my time customizing Linux distributions and showing off my creativity. 🐧 I'm a huge fan of Arch-based distros with i3-wm, but I also love using Fedora with Hyperland. 💻 If you want to see my Linux customization skills in action, head on over to [Unixporn](https://unixporn.com) and check it out! 🔥

Let's connect and build some amazing projects together! 🚀💻
