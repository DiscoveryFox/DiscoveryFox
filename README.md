# 💻🚀 Hello and welcome to my Github profile!

I'm a 15-year-old software engineer who is still in school in K-Town but also works at the IT department at Fraunhofer. 💻🔧 My main coding languages are Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, and Botscript (a language I created for easy Discord bot creation). 🤖 I'm also fluent in Java, Kotlin, C, C++, and C#. 💻

I have a passion for web development and I love using my skills in CSS/HTML to create amazing websites. 🌐 I consider myself a full-stack developer, but I can also work on the back-end or front-end if needed. I'm familiar with React, Tailwind, and Bootstrap frameworks and have experience with Flask, Django, and Selenium. 💻🚀

When I'm not coding, I love to spend my time customizing Linux distributions. 🐧 I'm a big fan of Arch-based distros with i3-wm, but I also enjoy using Fedora with Hyperland. 💻 If you're curious about my Linux customization skills, you can check out my work on [Unixporn](https://unixporn.com). 🔥

Let's connect and work on some amazing projects together! 🚀💻
