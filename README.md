# ðŸ‘‹ Hello! I'm a 15-year-old software engineer

I balance my time between school in K-Town and working at the IT department at Fraunhofer. My expertise lies in Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, and Botscript (a language I created for easy Discord bot creation). I'm also fluent in Java, Kotlin, C, C++, and C#.

I have a passion for web development, and my skills in CSS/HTML make me a strong full-stack or back-end developer. I'm familiar with React, Tailwind, and Bootstrap frameworks and have experience with Flask, Django, and Selenium.

In my free time, I enjoy customizing Linux distributions, especially my Arch-based distro with i3-wm. I'm also a fan of Fedora with Hyperland. You can see my work on [Unixporn](https://unixporn.com) where I showcase my Linux customization skills.

ðŸ’» Let's connect and work on some cool projects!
