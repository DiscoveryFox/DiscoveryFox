# 👋 Hey there, and welcome to my Github profile!

I'm a 15-year-old software engineer who is juggling school in K-Town 
and working at the awesome IT department at Fraunhofer. 💻🔧 My coding 
superpower lies in Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, and the language I 
created myself, Botscript, for creating Discord bots like a boss! 🤖 
I can also speak Java, Kotlin, C, C++, and C# fluently, so you know 
I mean business. 💻

Let's talk about web development, I love making tools look pretty! 💅 
I love using my CSS/HTML skills to add a touch of flair to tools like 
Hydra and Nmap, which usually only have a CLI interface. 🔨💻 And don't 
even get me started on my love for hacking! I'm a proud member of 
the Kali Linux community and always love to learn and improve my skills. 🕵️‍♂️

And let's not forget about my passion for building TUI's (terminal user interfaces) with Python and Textual! 💻💬
I've built amazing tools like a YouTube Music TUI or a web browser that tries to load websites, ports the HTML to Textual, and then displays the website as a native TUI app in the terminal. 💻🔥

I'm a full-stack kind of guy, but if you need a hand with either 
front-end or back-end, I got you! I'm familiar with React, Tailwind, 
and Bootstrap frameworks and have experience with Flask, Django, 
and Selenium. 💻🚀

When I'm not coding, I love to spend my time customizing Linux 
distributions and showing off my creativity. 🐧 I'm a huge fan of 
Arch-based distros with i3-wm, but I also love using Fedora with 
Hyperland. 💻 If you want to see my Linux customization skills in 
action, head on over to [Unixporn](https://unixporn.github.io/) and check it out! 🔥

Let's connect and build some amazing projects together! 🚀💻
